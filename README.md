Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Two main conclusions that can be understood from looking at Outcome data ased on Launch date is that there is a big uptick in successes for plays that launched in May and June. The other observation here is that kickstarters that launched in October genrally don't get cancelled if they don't do well these usually ends up lasting the entirety of their duration for their campaign compared to any other months.

Outcomes based on goals for plays seem to succeed far more when goal fundings are below $5000 or within 35000 to 44999. On the flip side, kcikstarters seem to fail around 15000 onwards all the way until 34999. Kickstarters for plays also seem to last the entirety of their deadline, without a single campaign cancelling regardless of the funding goals.

The biggest flaw in this dataset is that there are no details for the usages of the fundings itself. Although it is useful to know the successes and failures of kickstarters goals and pledged amounts are at, it is equally important to know where the fundings are allocated to within the campaign. A percentage breakdown of the fundings for the campaign or even just a short description for this would have made this dataset significantly better for analytics.
