# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. Included in this project are kickstarter data, along with visualized data trends on Outcomes based on Launch Date for the "Theater" parent category and Outcomes based on Goals for the "Plays" subcategory.

The purpose of this project is to help Louise get a more insightful look into the kickstarter funding campaigns of others who seeks out similar amounts for their plays, so that she is more prepared for her own play's campaign.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Two main conclusions that can be understood from looking at Outcome data ased on Launch date is that there is a big uptick in successes for plays that launched in May and June. The other observation here is that kickstarters that launched in October genrally don't get cancelled if they don't do well these usually ends up lasting the entirety of their duration for their campaign compared to any other months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Outcomes based on goals for plays seem to succeed far more when goal fundings are below $5000 or within 35000 to 44999. On the flip side, kcikstarters seem to fail around 15000 onwards all the way until 34999. Kickstarters for plays also seem to last the entirety of their deadline, without a single campaign cancelling regardless of the funding goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The biggest flaw in this dataset is that there are no details for the usages of the fundings itself. Although it is useful to know the successes and failures of kickstarters goals and pledged amounts are at, it is equally important to know where the fundings are allocated to within the campaign. A percentage breakdown of the fundings for the campaign or even just a short description for this would have made this dataset significantly better for analytics.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other possible tables and/or graphs are "Percentage of Successful campaigns vs Failed campaigns" for every Parent category of the kickstarter data which can be displayed neatly in a stacked divergent bar chart. This type of chart really highlights the positive and negatives of a subject in order to give meaningful insights on how the 2 outcome rank against each other. A possible immediate usage would be for investment firms who are looking for their next business opportunities, this shows how popular a particular category would be along with their successes and failures when it comes to seeking funding from others, therefore bringing up immediate risks and benefits when considering an investment.
